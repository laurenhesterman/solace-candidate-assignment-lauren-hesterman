## Other things I would do with more time
- Actually set up the database! Was going to save that for the end since I wanted to place more of my work emphasis on the front-end
- UPdate the API route to be more specific (ie. "/advocates"), potentially implement pagination, or maybe add the search term as a param
- Implement a table library such as ‘ant’. This would allow for much easier implementation of features such as pagination, sorting, other configs, etc with much less code. These features are important with large lists into the thousands of items
